# Theoretical Answers

Q1: How AI-driven code generation tools reduce development time and limitations
AI code-completion tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) speed development by generating boilerplate and idiomatic code patterns. They reduce context switches, accelerate prototyping, and surface common usage patterns. Limitations: incorrect or insecure suggestions, licensing/provenance concerns, hallucinations, and over-reliance that may erode deep developer knowledge. Project-specific semantics may not be captured.

Q2: Supervised vs. unsupervised learning in automated bug detection
Supervised learning requires labeled examples and is effective at detecting known bug types when data is representative. Unsupervised learning (clustering/anomaly detection) can discover novel issues without labels but tends to have higher false positive rates and requires human validation.

Q3: Why bias mitigation is critical for personalization
Personalization tailors experiences; biased data can cause unequal treatment of users, harm trust, and produce legally problematic outcomes. Mitigation ensures fairness, trust, and compliance.

Case study: AIOps improvements
- Predictive anomaly detection warns teams of potential rollout failures before they escalate.  
- Intelligent remediation automates common fixes or suggests actions based on historical runbooks, reducing MTTR.
